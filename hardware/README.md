# Printing
All parts have been designed to have one right print direction. You need to align them accordingly in your slicer.

The BeltTensionLever is needed 2x.

# z-Axis Scaling Issues
The stroker holders might come out too short due to general sup-par z-axis accuracy of many printers. They are designed in a way, that this can be easily compensated with their top parts. Just scale them accordingly in z-axis in your slicer. It doesn't need much filament and you don't need to reprint the full massive stroker holder.
